# Frontend Internship requirements

This doc refers to many external sources with a good capability to teach things that we at FlowUp use.

> :robot: This document will be updated as some things may change in the future.

## Version control

We use Git as a versioning tool for each project we do. Projects are commonly hosted on GitHub, thus the ability to work on projects
also comes with the ability to use Git and Github.

Here are handy links that may teach you how to use these tools:
- [Git Official page](https://git-scm.com/) - you can download git here
- [Learn Git by Github (and Codecademy)](https://try.github.io) - this is where you may want to start
- [Git & Github course of Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

## Technologies

Frontend internships are gonna teach you a lot about [Angular](https://angular.io/), but there are several prerequisites that you should be familiar with.

- [HTML & CSS at Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) should help you to understand basics of web pages if you are a newcomer
- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) helps to better organize CSS code and is widely used within our team
- [JavaScript at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) will help you to understand basics of web scripting. You will be using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html) here, but JS is a prerequisite to this
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is superset of JS. Based on usage of Types and latest ES features. Angular is written in TS
  - [TS Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) is very usefull guide for understanding of TS
  - [TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html) for quick try of examples

In case you know everything from above, there is a [really nice tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/learning-angular.html) for Angular itself.
